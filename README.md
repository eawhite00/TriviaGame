# TriviaGame
This project was developed as part of my coursework at the UW coding boot camp. It's primary purpose is to demostrate that I understand how timers work in Javascript.

# Implementation
I opted to do the more challening assignment, with an individual timer for each round as well as timers in between rounds before displaying the next question.

My theme was trivia about people named Dave because I couldn't think of anything and then the name "Dave" popped into my head and I thought it was funny.

I used bootstrap for my UI layout becaue I'm bad at using it and needed the practice.

# Improvements / Changes
If I were to refactor the project I'd create a Trivia Question object instead of just connecting a few different arrays. I'd generate new elements instead of displaying / hiding them the way I did.

If I were to expand this project into something more robust and 'playable', I'd generate a much longer list of trivia questions and display them randomly (marking questions as 'asked' to avoid repeats)
